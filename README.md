## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how necessary it is to know the overflow property to be able to position elements like images well.

I also learned the z-index property to overlap the elements. Even if I don't use it.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  overflow: hidden;
  /* overflow: visible;
    overflow: scroll; */
  z-index: 1;
}
```
